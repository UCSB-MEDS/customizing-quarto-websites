## {#tldr data-menu-title="TL;DR"}

<p class="slide-title">TL;DR</p>

<div class="body-text topbr">When we render a new Quarto site, it converts all of our markdown into HTML and applies a pre-built default CSS stylesheet (the Bootswatch [Cosmo theme](https://bootswatch.com/cosmo/)). We can modify the appearance of our website in a number of ways. We'll learn a bit about the following (but know that this is just a starting point!):</div>

. . . 

<div class="caption-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`**Editing the `index.qmd` YAML** -- you can apply a [pre-built template](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates) to give your landing page a sleek and professional appearance (we can further modify this later with some CSS).</div>

. . .

<div class="caption-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  **Editing the `_quarto.yml` file** -- here we can easily update our top navigation bar (e.g. add new pages), add a page footer, a [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon), Google Analytics, declare a main font, and more. We can also switch the default theme to a different pre-built [Bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/) (by replacing `cosmo` with an alternative theme name).</div>

. . .

<div class="caption-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  **Creating a `.scss` file(s)** that contains [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) variables to quickly customize your website's theme -- these take the form of `$var-name: value;` and you can find a list of them in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#sass-variables).</div>

. . . 

<div class="caption-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` **Define CSS rules in the `styles.css` file** that comes with every new Quarto site. This allows you to fine-tune the appearance of your site.</div>

. . . 

<div class="caption-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` **Combine all of the above!** Approaching this in the following order worked best for me: **First** add a template to `index.qmd`, then fill out as much of the `_quarto.yml` file as you can/want -- this is the easiest way to add some really cool features with minimal effort. **Next**, create a `mystyles.scss` file (name it however you want), link to it in `_quarto.yml` (this applies your styles to your Quarto site), and define your Sass variables. **Finally** make fine-tuned adjustments by defining CSS rules directly in your `mystyles.scss` file (you can write CSS in SCSS files, but not the other way around).</div>

::: {.column width="40%"}
<br>
<div class="body-text topbr">[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) gives us with an easy-to-use web publishing format to create our personal websites -- we can develop in a space that is comfortable (for me, that's RStudio) and write mostly Markdown syntax (which is rendered as HTML when we build our website). A massive benefit is that these websites already look pretty slick right out of the box.</div>
