## {#prerequisites data-menu-title="Prerequisites"}

[{{< fa check title="check mark" >}} Prerequisites]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text}
You should already have a Quarto website (or at least the bones of one) that:
:::

::: {.body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** is deployed using GitHub Pages **and**

**{{< fa angle-right >}}** contains *some* content (e.g. text, headings, etc.) for us to customize
:::

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "85%" 
#| fig-alt: "Two penguins looking happily up at a Quarto logo 'meteor' that is flying overhead."
knitr::include_graphics("images/penguins_meteor.png")
```

## {#tldr1 data-menu-title="TL;DR"}

[TL;DR]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text}
When we render a new Quarto site, it converts all of our markdown into HTML and applies a pre-built CSS stylesheet (the Bootswatch [Cosmo theme](https://bootswatch.com/cosmo/)). We can modify the appearance of our website in a number of ways. We'll learn a bit about the following (but know that this is just a starting point!):
:::

::: incremental
::: {.body-text-s}
- **Editing the `index.qmd` YAML** -- you can apply a [pre-built template](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates) to give your landing page a sleek and professional appearance (we can further modify this later with some CSS).

- **Editing the `_quarto.yml` file** -- here we can easily update our top navigation bar (e.g. add new pages), add a page footer, a [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon), Google Analytics, declare a main font, and more. We can also switch the default theme to a different pre-built [Bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/) (by replacing `cosmo` with an alternative theme name).

- **Defining CSS rules in the `styles.css` file** that comes with every new Quarto site. This allows you to fine-tune the appearance of your site.

- **Creating a `.scss` file(s)** that contains [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) variables to quickly customize your website's theme -- these take the form of `$var-name: value;` and you can find a list of them in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#sass-variables).

<hr>

<br>

::: {.body-text-xl .teal-text .center-text .bottombr}
Combine all of the above!
:::

::: {.body-text-l .center-text}
Approaching this in the following order worked best for me:
:::

. . .

::: incremental
::: {.body-text .bottombr}
- **First**, add a template to `index.qmd`, then fill out as much of the `_quarto.yml` file as you can/want -- this is the easiest way to add some really cool features with minimal effort.

- **Next**, create a `styles.scss` file (name it however you want), link to it in `_quarto.yml` (this applies your styles to your Quarto site), and define your Sass variables.

- **Finally**, make fine-tuned adjustments by defining CSS rules directly in your `styles.scss` file (you can write CSS in `.scss` files, but not Sass in `.css` files).

## {#branches data-menu-title="Use branches!"}

[{{< fa code-branch >}} Working on branches is recommended!]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

::: {.body-text-l .center-text}
*I almost always work on a branch when making changes to my website -- this way I can safely test changes before deploying them to my live site.*
:::

::: {.body-text-s}
To create a branch, first ensure that you're on `main` by typing either `git branch` or `git status` into the RStudio Terminal (either will tell you which branch you're currently on). If you're not on `main`, you can switch by running `git checkout main`.
:::

::: {.body-text-s}
Create a local git branch from `main` by running the following in your Terminal:
:::

```{bash filename="Command line/RStudio Terminal"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

::: {.body-text-s}
Push your new local branch to GitHub by running the following in your terminal:
:::

```{bash filename="Command line/RStudio Terminal"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
git push -u origin my-new-branch
```

::: {.body-text-s .topbr}
You're now ready to work as normal! Once satisfied with your changes, you can `git add`, `git commit -m "my commit message"`, and `git push` (or use the RStudio GUI buttons in the **Git** tab) your files. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from GitHub and [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) into `main` to integrate your changes.

## {#so-youve-created-a-website data-menu-title="So you've created a Quarto website..."}

[So you've created your personal website using Quarto...]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.column width="40%"}

<br>
<br>
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) gives us an easy-to-use web publishing format to create our personal websites -- we can develop in a space that is comfortable (for me, that's RStudio) and write mostly Markdown syntax (which is rendered as HTML when we build our website). A massive benefit is that these websites already look pretty slick right out of the box.
