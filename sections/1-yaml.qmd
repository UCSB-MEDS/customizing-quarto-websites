::::

## Notes

::: {.caption-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Use the `about` option in the YAML section of `index.qmd` to turn your landing page into an [About Page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) -- supply it with one of five template options (here, I chose `trestles`). It *is not* necessary to do this (you can fully build/customize your web page layout using CSS), but it's a fast way to create a clean, professional-looking landing page. **NOTE:** Any of your web pages can be turned into an About Page.
:::

::: {.caption-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** The `links` option under `about` allows you to create buttons underneath your landing page photo. You need to supply a `text` (as you'd like it to appear on the button) and an `href` (a link), and optionally can supply an `icon`.
:::

::: {.caption-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** You'll need to install the [Quarto fontawesome extension](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) if you'd like to include icons throughout your site (including your About Page buttons). Run `quarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome` in your RStudio Terminal, which downloads the extension files and saves them to your project directory (you should see a new folder, `_extensions/quarto-ext/fontawesome/` in your project directory). **NOTE:** You'll need to install this for each project where you'd like to use [fontawesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/).

## {#add-pages data-menu-title="Add pages"}

[Update your navbar]{.slide-title-smaller}

<hr>

::: {.smaller-body-text}
Any edits you want to make to your navbar happen under the `website:` > `navbar:` option in your `_quarto.yml` file.
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## `_quarto.yml` file

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6-19"
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  navbar:
    title: "Samantha Csik" # this is the website title as it appears in the top left corner -- clicking on this will jump you back to your landing page from where ever you are
    right: # align navbar items to the right/left/center
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home # use 'text' option to update the name as you want it to appear in your navbar
      - about.qmd
      - href: resources.qmd
        text: Resources
      - href: cv/myCV.pdf
        text: CV
      - icon: github # add icons that link to social media, etc.
        href: https://github.com/samanthacsik

## Output

#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "75%" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/add_navbar_items.png")
```

## Notes

::: {.smaller-body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Right/center/left align your navbar contents using the `website:` > `navbar:` > `right`/`center`/`left:` option. Add navbar pages as an indented list beneath this option.
:::

::: {.smaller-body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Navbar page names will appear the same as the title given to each `.qmd` file (e.g. in the YAML of `about.qmd`, the `title` option has the value `About`, and therefore appears in the navbar as "**About**"). You can update the name as it appears in your navbar by providing the `text` option when linking your new page in `_quarto.yml` (see "Home" and "Resources" pages as examples).
:::


::: {.smaller-body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Link your resume or CV by providing a file path to the pdf in `href` (e.g. `href: file/path/to/CV.pdf`) and the text as you'd like it to appear in your navbar (see example provided). This will open up the browser-based pdf viewer when clicked. Be sure to provide the `text` option with the title as you'd like it to appear in your navbar.

## {#add-favicon data-menu-title="Add favicon & logo"}

[Add a favicon & personal logo]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text}
A [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) is a small icon used on web browsers to represent a website or a web page. Get creative and use a custom favicon that complements your personal logo.

```{r}
#| eval: false

website:
  favicon: file/path/to/image.png

## Output

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "60%" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/favicon_logo.png")
```

## Notes

::: {.smaller-body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Create your own logo using the free [Adobe Express Logo Maker](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo) to include in the top left corner of your website (clicking on this will take you back to your site's landing page) -- provide Adobe with a little info about yourself, and it'll return a bunch of AI-generated logos for you to choose from and customize further. I used this service to also create my favicon. **Tip:** You can download logos with a transparent background so that they can be placed anywhere on your site without having to deal with mismatched background colors. I also recommend making them as large as possible *before* downloading -- doing so *may* circumvent having to adjust the logo size using CSS.
