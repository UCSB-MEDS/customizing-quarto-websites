## Notes

::: {.caption-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Use the `about` option in the YAML section of `index.qmd` to turn your landing page into an [About Page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) -- supply it with one of five template options (here, I chose `trestles`). It *is not* necessary to do this (you can fully build/customize your web page layout using CSS), but it's a fast way to create a clean, professional-looking landing page. **NOTE:** Any of your webpages can be turned into an About Page.
:::

::: {.caption-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** The `links` option under `about` allows you to create buttons underneath your landing page photo. You need to supply a `text` (as you'd like it to appear on the button) and an `href` (a link), and optionally can supply an icon.
:::

::: {.caption-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** You'll need to install the quarto fontawesome extension to include icons throughout your site (including your About Page buttons). Run `quarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome` in your RStudio terminal. **NOTE:** You'll need to install this for each project where you'd like to use fontawesome icons.

## {#add-pages data-menu-title="Add pages"}

[Add additional pages (& clickable icons) to your navbar & add a footer]{.slide-title-smaller}

<hr>

::: {.panel-tabset}

## `_quarto.yml` file

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "13-19|20-29"
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "samantha csik"
  navbar:
    title: samanthacsik # this is the website title as it appears in the top left corner -- clicking on this will jump you back to your landing page from where ever you are
    right: # align navbar items to the right/left/center
      - href: index.qmd
        text: home # use 'text' option to update the name as you want it to appear in your navbar
      - about.qmd
      - resources.qmd
      - href: CV/SCsik_CV.pdf
        text: cv
      - icon: github # add icons that link to social media, etc.
        href: https://github.com/samanthacsik
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com/SamanthaCsik
    page-footer:

        href: https://twitter.com/SamanthaCsik

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

## Output

<center><img src="images/add_navbar_items.png" width="600"/></center>

## Notes

::: {.smaller-body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** The navbar page names will appear as the title given to each `.qmd` file (e.g. in the YAML of `about.qmd`, the `title` option has the value `about`, and therefore appears in the navbar as "**about**"). However you can update the name as it appears in your navbar by providing the `text` option when linking your new page in `_quarto.yml`.
:::

::: {.smaller-body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Link your resume or CV by providing a file path to the pdf in `href` (e.g. `href: file/path/to/CV.pdf`) and the text as you'd like it to appear in your navbar (see example provided). This will open up the browser-based pdf viewer when clicked. Be sure to provide the `text` option with the title as you'd like it to appear in your navbar.

website:

## Output

```{r}

#| out-width: "60%" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/favicon_logo.png")
```

## Notes

::: {.smaller-body-text}
**{{< fa angle-right >}}** Create your own logo using the free [Adobe Express Logo Maker](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo) to include in the top left corner of your website (clicking on this will take you back to your site's landing page) -- provide Adobe with a little info about yourself, and it'll return a bunch of AI-generated logos for you to choose from and customize further. I used this service to also create my favicon. **Tip:** You can download logos with a transparent background, or with a background that matches the color you plan to change your navbar to (as in this example). I also recommend making them as large as possible *before* downloading -- doing so may circumvent having to adjust the logo size using CSS (I realized that after the fact `r fontawesome::fa("smile", fill = "#222222", a11y = "sem")`).
