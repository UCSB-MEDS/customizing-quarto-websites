For me, it’s **a lot** of it is trial and error. Inspecting your website can take patience and persistence to figure out how exactly to target your desired element. Some things that have helped me:
<!-- ...and honestly, ***a lot*** of it is trial and error. Inspecting (*reminder: right-click on an element in your website preview and choose "Inspect"*) your website can take patience and persistence to figure out how exactly to target your desired element. -->

- re-rendering often to ensure your Sass / CSS is working as expected
- Google! (lots of queries that look like, “CSS underline text”, “CSS rounded corners”, etc.)
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) – seriously such a valuable resource (especially their interactive tutorials)
- drawing inspiration (and borrowing source code) from other web pages

Exploring the source code for other websites, presentations, etc. is, *in my opinion*, critical for learning this new skill and applying it to your own work.

::: {.center-text .body-text-m}
You don't need to limit yourself to *just* Quarto websites -- check out the stylesheets for Quarto docs, presentations (*cough cough* like [this very presentation](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/customizing-quarto-websites)), Shiny apps / dashboards, [Distill sites](https://distillery.rbind.io/), and more.

<!-- **{{< fa angle-right >}}** More and more Quarto websites are popping up all the time -- Twitter is (or at least was...) a great spot to find folks sharing their sites (I'll never stop obsessing over [Maya Gans' Quarto site](https://maya.rbind.io/)). You can also explore the source code and stylesheets for Quarto presentations (*cough cough,* like [this very presentation](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/customizing-quarto-websites)), books, and more. **My approach for getting started:** Find a page element that you like and look at the HTML. Identify the HTML tag (e.g. `<h1>`) and if it has any additional selectors (e.g. class or ID selectors). Head over to the stylesheet and search for any relevant selectors to see how they were created. -->

<!-- **{{< fa angle-right >}}** And don't limit yourself to Quarto sites! Check out [The Distillery Showcase](https://distillery.rbind.io/), which links to a long list of websites built with R's `{distill}` package (**Note:** the `{distill}` framework *is* a bit different -- when exploring `.css` files, look for CSS selectors beneath the section `/*-- Additional custom styles --*/`). -->

##  {#inspect-edit data-menu-title="'Edit' while you Inspect"}

[Temporarily "edit" CSS using the DevTools pane]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

::: {.body-text-s}
Play around with selectors and update declaration values while inspecting your website. This allows you to try out styles before actually hard-coding them, and *also* helps you identify exactly which elements different selectors are manipulating. It can sometimes take a little digging in the Inspect pane to find what you're looking for.

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "60%" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/inspect-edit.gif")
```

::: {.footer}
**Note** that these changes are only *temporary* -- refreshing your web browser will revert your site back to its original state.
