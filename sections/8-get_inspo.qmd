##  {#look-at-other-sites data-menu-title="Look at other websites"}

<p class="slide-title">Check out source code (specifically the stylesheets) of other sites</p>

<br>

. . . 

<p class="caption-text topbr bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Learn from others! Exploring the source code for other websites, presentations, etc. is, in my opinion, critical for learning this new skill and applying it to your own work.</p> 

<br>

. . . 

<p class="caption-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  More and more Quarto websites are popping up all the time -- keep an eye out on Twitter for folks sharing their sites! (I'll never stop obsessing over [Maya Gans' Quarto site](https://maya.rbind.io/)). You can also explore the source code and stylesheets for Quarto presentations (*cough cough,* like [this very presentation](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/customizing-quarto-websites)), books, and more.</p>

<br>

. . . 

<p class="caption-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  And don't limit yourself to Quarto sites! Check out [The Distillery Showcase](https://distillery.rbind.io/), which links to a long list of websites built with R's `{distill}` package (**Note:** the `{distill}` framework *is* a bit different -- when exploring `.css` files, look for CSS selectors beneath the section `/*-- Additional custom styles --*/`).</p>

##  {#inspect-edit data-menu-title="'Edit' while you Inspect"}

<p class="slide-title">Inspecting web pages allows you to temporarily "edit" CSS</p>

<p class="caption-text bottombr">Play around with selectors and update declaration values (or add/remove declarations) while inspecting your website. This not only allows you to try out styles before actually hard-coding them, but it also helps you identify exactly which elements different selectors are manipulating. **Note** that these changes are only *temporary* -- refreshing your web browser will revert your site back to it's original state.</p>

##  {#interactive-tutorials data-menu-title="Interactive tutorials"}

<p class="slide-title">Take advantage of interactive tutorials</p>

<p class="body-text bottombr">[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) has *tons* of great examples and interactive tutorials for learning CSS. Touching (and breaking) code is one of the best ways to learn!</p>
