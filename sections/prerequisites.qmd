## {#prerequisites data-menu-title="Prerequisites"}

[`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "#003660", a11y = "sem")` Prerequisites]{.smaller .slide-title}

You should already have a Quarto website (or at least the bones of one) that is:

::: {.incremental}
-   <span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>deployed using GitHub Pages **and**</span>
-   <span style = 'font-size: 80%;'>contains *some* content (e.g. text, headings, etc.) for us to customize</span>
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-alt: "Two penguins looking happily up at a Quarto logo 'meteor' that is flying overhead." 
knitr::include_graphics("images/penguins_meteor.png")
```
<center><span style = 'font-size: 70%; color: #868A8F;'>Art by [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)</span></center>

::: footer
If you first need to get your website up and running, follow along with these [step-by-step instructions](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/) before moving forward.

## {#so-youve-created-a-website data-menu-title="So you've created a Quarto website..."}

[So you've created your personal website using Quarto...]{.smaller .slide-title}

::: {.column width="40%"}
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) gives us with an easy-to-use web publishing format to create our personal websites. A massive benefit is that these websites already look pretty slick right out of the box.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-alt: "An example Quarto website with default styling using the built-in Bootswatch theme, Cosmo" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/website_noCSS.png")
```

## {#modify-to-stand-out data-menu-title="Make your website stand stand out"}

[But some additional modifications can make *your* website stand out from the rest]{.slide-title} 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "Alecia Keys, a judge on the TV show, The Voice, excited slams her hands down and stands up saying, 'There is nobody like you!'" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/unique.gif")
```

## {#enter-css-sass data-menu-title="Enter CSS & Sass"}

[Enter CSS and Sass]{.slide-title}

In order to make those changes, we need to dive a bit into the world of **CSS** and **Sass**. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "The CSS 3 and Sass logos" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/css_sass.png")
```

<span style = 'font-size: 60%;'>Some of you may have already heard of and/or used CSS -- that's great! We're going to spend a few minutes first learning about what makes a web page...look like a web page, then apply what we learn to our own Quarto sites.</span>
