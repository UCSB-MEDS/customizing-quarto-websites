You should already have a Quarto website (or at least the bones of one) that is:

::: {.incremental}
-   deployed using GitHub Pages **and**
-   contains *some* content (e.g. text, headings, etc.) for us to customize
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-alt: "Two penguins looking happily up at a Quarto logo 'meteor' that is flying overhead." 
knitr::include_graphics("images/penguins_meteor.png")
```
